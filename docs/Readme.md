# market-place
Create an online marketplace that operates on the blockchain.
 
There are a list of stores on a central marketplace where shoppers can purchase goods posted by the store owners.
 
The central marketplace is managed by a group of administrators. Admins allow store owners to add stores to the marketplace. Store owners can manage their storeâ€™s inventory and funds. Shoppers can visit stores and purchase goods that are in stock using cryptocurrency.

# Project Setup 

## Creating a project
> mkdir marketplace
> cd marketplace/

Use the following command to create the project:
> truffle init

You shall get something like this:
![Truffle Init](https://github.com/wtcalok/market-place/blob/master/Images/TruffleInit.png)

## Create contracts
Launch _atom_ editor from your project directory. 

Create the following files in the **contract** directory:
- MarketPlace.sol
- Store.sol

Also, create a directory for the library in the contract directory:
> mkdir library

Create the following file in that:
- Utils.sol

Refer to the source files for the exact code. 

## Compile and Deploy Contract
### Add network details in truffle.js file
```
module.exports = {
  networks : {
    ganache: {
      host:'127.0.0.1',
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "5777",
      gas : 4500000,
      gasPrice : 10000000000 // in Wei
    }
  }
};
```

Use the following command to deploy / redeploy the contract in the test environment:
```
truffle migrate --reset --compile-all --network ganache
```

## Unit Testing
1. Go to the contract folder

Run the following command:
```
truffle test --network ganache ./test/1_HappyPath.js 
```
