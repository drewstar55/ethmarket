# Contracts
1. In the withdrawFund function, I used *Fail early and fail loud* pattern to ensure that zero amount withdrwal doesn't take place
2. *Restricting Access* - Restrict other contractsâ€™ access to the state by making all the state variables private. 


# Testing 
1. Async and Await pattern was used to make the test cases look simpler
